// Strict mode in JavaScript, activated with the directive "use strict";,
// provides a more rigorous and error-preventing development environment.
// When enabled, strict mode enforces stricter rules, such as requiring variable declarations with var, let, or const before use,
// disallowing assignments to read-only properties, preventing the deletion of variables or function names, and more.
// It helps catch common mistakes that might otherwise be ignored in non-strict mode,
// promoting code quality and preventing the use of error-prone features.
// Strict mode can be applied to the entire script or specific functions, 
// making it a valuable tool for maintaining a cleaner and more reliable codebase.
